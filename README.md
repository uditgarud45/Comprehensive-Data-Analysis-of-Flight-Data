# Comprehensive-Data-Analysis-of-Flight-Data

## Overview
Utilized the power of Pandas to import and explore structured data from CSV files, conducting a comprehensive data analysis on flight details.

## Missing Data Strategies
Addressed missing values with precision:
- Dropped columns with less than 5% missing data.
- Imputed missing prices based on airline medians.

## Visualization
Crafted insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn:
- Explored the distribution of flight prices by airline with a box plot.
- Unveiled flight duration categories with a count plot, revealing short-haul, medium, and long-haul flights.
- Visualized the impact of flight duration on prices with a scatter plot.

## Categorical Data Manipulation
Dealt with categorical data intricacies:
- Created flight duration categories based on time thresholds.
- Transformed duration data for meaningful analysis, including histogram plots.

## Outlier Handling
Ensured data reliability by addressing outliers using the interquartile range:
- Removed extreme values to maintain data integrity for statistical tests and machine learning models.

## Hypothesis Generation
Explored potential relationships and patterns through hypothesis generation:
- Conducted correlation analysis and heatmap visualization.
- Investigated spurious correlations through scatter plots, guiding the formulation of meaningful hypotheses.

## Data Snooping and Future Exploration
Guarded against data snooping by generating hypotheses for future exploration:
- Bar plots showcasing the relationship between airline and flight duration, as well as destination and flight prices.
